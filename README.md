# 02_CREATING_A_PROFESSIONAL_PORTFOLIO_PAGE

- Project shows my deployed website, showing projects I have worked on.
- Coding includes usage of hover and how it can be used to highlight different areas and trigger a note to the user to click. This can be used to show user you can jump to another section of the page, or to open another page entirely.
- Alt tags allow reader to understand photos, that they may not be able to see.
- Labeling sections allows them to understand what area of the site they are on.
- A media querie has been added to adjust to mobile setting.
